a. Class Initialization

       attributes:

               s: values in the set as a list

               size: number of values in the set as an int

               s: initially empty

               size: initially 0

b. search function to look for value in list

         input: any value

         outputs: true or false whether the value is in the list

                     a for loop check each value in list

                     true or false if the value checked is the value being searched for

                     returns false if the element searched for isn't in the set

c. insert function to add a value to list

             input: value added to list

             no output

                             value is added to the end of the list 

                             check if the value that is being added already exists in the list using the previous search function

                             the size attribute needs to increase

d. delete function to remove a value from list

              input: value to be deleted

              output: true or false indicating if the value is removed

                         for loop to check each value in the list 

                         deleting an value affects the positions of other values in the list 

                         list size and value position needs to change

e. traverse function to display all value in the list

              no input

              output: displays list of values

                            return the values of the list
